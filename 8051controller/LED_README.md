## Program Description

The program uses a simple delay function to blink an LED connected to pin P2 of the 8051 microcontroller. The delay function generates a delay of approximately 1 second, and is called twice in the main function - once to turn the LED on, and once to turn it off.
## How to Use
1. Connect the LED and resistor in series with a breadboard.
2. Connect the positive leg of the LED to pin P2.0 of the 8051 microcontroller.
3. Connect the negative leg of the LED to the resistor, and connect the other end of the resistor to the ground.
4. Compile the source code and burn it onto the microcontroller.
5. Power on the circuit and watch the LED blink.
